After seeing this image (https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-francine) go viral on Twitter I decided to spend sometime practicing my own CSS skills.

# Day 1: Image 1
Part of a monthly goal to create one pure CSS image a day for the remainder of May 2018 (began 5/7/18)

I decided to begin by following along with https://medium.com/coding-artist/a-beginners-guide-to-pure-css-images-ef9a5d069dd2
